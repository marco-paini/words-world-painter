# Words World Painter

Sometimes I have to describe what I have in mind, but happens that I can't find the right words or they couldn't understand entirely.

Has it ever happened to you something similar?

Using the emerging technology of Virtual Reality we want to offer a tool to improve expression skills that can be used by people of almost every age. With Words World Painter you can make (PAINT) new and marvellous worlds with only the words you know.

The most your language knowledge and expression skills are wide, the more detailed will be your thoughts that will be showed into a virtual world similar to reality.

## Goals

Our goal is to provide an instrument to improve expressive abilities of people, which, for some reason such as unknown languages, expressive difficulties or other diseases are not able to express correctly their ideas. Using Virtual Reality, the user will have a real-time feedback about his speech that will help him to verify if what he is saying will match what he has in his mind.

It will allow to have an "unreal" representation in terms of image, scene, dream or whatever situation could be transmitted not only with simple words but through a direct visualization of the image.

We can refer, for example, to a deaf person who is informed of facts not only with the sign language but also next to the draw visualization.

## Challenges

- Integration all the used technologies;
- Translate correctly the speech semantic to the materialized view;
- Give a useful, simple and clear instrument.

## Solution

We developed an environment that integrating all the above mentioned technologies, enable the user to tell a tale, a scene or whatever to automatically elaborate the described scenes in a transparent way using the unreal engine and all the features it offers.
